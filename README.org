** Fast5 Library

A lightweight C++11 library to read raw signal data from Oxford Nanopore's Fast5 files.

*** Installation Instructions

This is a header-only library, so you only need to copy [[src/fast5.hpp]] and [[src/hdf5_tools.hpp]] into your project.

*** Usage Instructions

See [[src/f5dump.cpp]] for an example.

*** Python Wrapper

To install a python wrapper for this library:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd python
HDF5_DIR=/usr/local BOOST_DIR=/usr/local make develop-user
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notes:

- HDF5 and Boost.Python must be available, and their locations can be passed on to the Python setup process using the environment variables =HDF5_DIR= and =BOOST_DIR=. Alternatively, the include directory, library directory, and library name may be specified explicitly with, e.g. =HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR=, =HDF5_LIB_DIR=, and =HDF5_LIB=. For details, see [[file:python/setup.py][python/setup.py]].

- To install =fast5= as a package in a virtualenv, use the target =develop=. To install as a user package, use the target =develop-user=. For details, see [[file:python/Makefile][python/Makefile]].
